*   It's tempting to think of science as purely meritocratic
    *   "If I do good science, it should speak for itself"
    *   "Advertising is pretentious and self-serving"
*   In reality, scientists are social creatures
    *   We all have our own social networks of trust
    *   Technology has helped with discoverability of new research
    *   Still not as effective as getting airtime from a "high-profile" outlet
        *   "Glamour" journal (Nature, Science, etc.)
        *   Twitter account of a "big shot" in the field
*   Don't be afraid to [market your project][kuchner-marketing]
    *   If it really is good, you should tell people about it
*   The concert merchandise model
    *   Your grant proposals are your product
    *   Your papers are your advertisements
*   Consider the following:
    *   What part does software play in your research?
    *   Who procures funding for your research, and what are the expectations about software of those funding agencies?
    *   Are you funded/employed primarily to produce software tools? Or to produce theories/models/results/methods?
*   We should clarify what marketing means
    *   It is not being pushy
    *   It is not shameless self-promotion
    *   "Marketing is the craft of seeing things from other people's perspective, understanding their wants and needs, and finding ways to meet them." --Marc Kuchner
    *   It is connecting with others in a sincere way
    *   It is ensuring our work is relevant to "important people" and their concerns
    *   Here, "important people" mean people that are in a position to make decisions about funding, hiring, tenure, etc.
*   Use social media and blogs
    *   Papers must be objective, social media posts don't
        *   You can talk about what excites you about the research
        *   You can be personal and set whatever tone you'd like
        *   You can go out on a limb and make guesses, claims, and other statements that might not get past peer reviewers
            *   The most important question isn't necessarily whether you're right, but whether you can engage your colleagues and get them thinking critically about your work.
    *   Worst-case scenario: nobody will listen
    *   Best-case: the right people will notice, remember, and maybe even advertise your work
*   Make the main paper(s) you want people to cite obvious, in the documentation and in a `CITATION` file alongside the `README`
    *   If there isn't a paper yet, get agreement on what's needed for a "code paper"
    *   Journals like [JOSS][joss] and [JORS][jors] have clear guidelines and checklists
    *   Keep planning for future papers and how people should be credited for their work so that the community remains engaged and committed
    *   See [this example][software-paper-authorship] of a discussion
