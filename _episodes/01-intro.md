title: "Introduction"
teaching: 5
exercises: 10
questions:
- "What are the key differences between research software and 'normal' projects?"
- "What does 'done' look like for a research software project?"
- "What are the goals of this class?"
objectives:
- "Compare and contrast research software projects and 'normal' software projects."
- "Name and explain key features of a mature research software project."
keypoints:
- "Requirements for small research software projects are typically emergent."
- "Research software is 'good enough' when people other than its authors can use it with confidence and extend it with reasonable effort."

*   Key differences between research software and "normal" projects
    *   Requirements may be either:
        *   Discovered as we go along (exploring)
        *   Relatively stable (engineering)
    *   Problem is *subtle* as well as *complicated*
        *   Control flow may be very simple...
        *   ...but figuring out exactly what coefficients and indexes to use can be very hard
*   What does "done" look like?
    1.  Software can be used by people other than original authors
        *   Reproducibility meaningless without this
    2.  Reasonably confident that results are correct
        *   As trustworthy as physical experiment
    3.  Small changes and extensions are easy
        *   I.e., researchers can safely make small changes to code
    4.  Fast enough to be useful
    5.  Can be maintained by people other than its original author(s)
        *   I.e., it is *sustainable*
*   For our purposes:
    *   3x6: three people for six months
    *   Contributors are frequently time-slicing other projects
    *   "Everybody makes coffee"
*   Goals for this class
    *   Understand how to go from ad hoc solo project to reliable small-team project

> ## Describe How Your Project is Managed
>
> Write a short point-form description (5-6 bullets) of how your current project is managed:
>
> 1.  Who uses the software?
> 2.  How?
> 3.  How do they find the software?
> 4.  How do they set it up?
> 5.  Who decides what to change and when?
> 6.  How are decisions and changes circulated?
