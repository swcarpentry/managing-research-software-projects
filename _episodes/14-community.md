*   Clearly identify members of core team
    *   Who is a primary part of the project and what rights does that give them
    *   What do *they* need to get out of the project and when (e.g., completion of thesis or contract)
    *   Review annually (at least)
*   Treat every user as a potential contributor
    *   Makes it more likely that others will use your software
    *   Increases the odds of survival for your work when funding runs out or you move on
    *   More likely to impact traditional academic metrics (i.e., citations)
*   Be clear about what peripheral participation means
    *   Make it clear that you respect research confidentiality and define what that actually means
        *   E.g., have explicit agreements about data availability, publication embargoes, etc.
        *   Even (or especially) if the project is "all open, all the time"
    *   Be explicit about when and how software changes will be integrated so that people have reasonable expectations
*   [Steinmacher][steinmacher-barriers] identified two main barriers to contribution in open projects
    1.  How easy is it to get set up?
    2.  How friendly was reception of first contribution?
*   Every project should include a contributor code of conduct
    *   And every project leader should think about [what it's like to be in a vulnerable group][ride-like-a-girl]
    *   Use [Contributor Covenant][contributor-covenant] by default
    *   Make the process for complaint, appeal, and adjudication *very* clear
        *   And make the first point of contact very clear as well
    *   Needs:
        *   Incident response plan (i.e., who does what when an incident occurs)
        *   Widespread promotion (people have to know it exists and where to find it)
*   Most important next step is to manage communication
    *   Small projects converge on one channel (i.e., issues, mailing list, Slack)
        *   "Someone mailed me your tweet about the Slack discussion so I filed a GitHub issue about updating the Google Doc. Wait, why are you crying?"
    *   Strongly prefer email for general discussion: ubiquitous, threaded, and asynchronous
        *   But only if publicly archived
        *   Point-to-point email makes key information unfindable and fosters cliques
    *   And discussion threads on issues for specific topics (to avoid overwhelming general channel)
*   Use video conferencing and in-person meetings to build community, not to share information
    *   People can read faster than you can talk
*   Avoid [common communication pitfalls][producing-oss-pitfalls]
    *   Don't post without a purpose
    *   Don't rehash previous discussion
        *   Summarize in blog posts or web pages and point people at those
    *   Avoid bikeshedding
        *   "The smaller the problem, the longer the debate"
    *   Throttle discussion
        *   One post per person per topic per day
*   [Recurse Center's social rules][recurse-social-rules]
    *   No feigning surprise
    *   No "well, actually"
    *   No back-seat driving
    *   No subtle -isms
*   Be clear when the group is deciding and when it is merely advising
    *   Distinguish between inquiry and delegation
        *   "Could you please look at X?" is ambiguous
*   Share management tasks as well as technical tasks
    *   Make it clear what has been delegated
    *   Follow up on everything you delegate
    *   Be clear about what "done" looks like
