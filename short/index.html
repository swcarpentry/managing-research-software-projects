<!-- @ scope of this talk -->
<section data-markdown>
**What Kinds of Projects?**

*   3x3: three people for three months
*   Contributors are frequently time-slicing other projects
*   "Everybody makes coffee"
</section>

<!-- @ goals -->
<section data-markdown>
**What "Done" Looks Like**

*   Software can be used by people other than original authors
    *   Reproducibility meaningless without this
*   Reasonably confident that results are correct
    *   As good as physical experiment
*   Small changes and extensions are easy
    *   Regression tests make change safe - [Feathers](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052/)
*   Fast enough to be useful
</section>

<!-- Revisit this slide: software sustainability vs supporting academic software sustainably -->
<!-- @ sustainability -->
<!--<section data-markdown>
**A Note on Sustainability**

*   Meaningless to speak of "sustainable software"
*   Effort = size of change / (developers' skill * code quality)
*   But even this is misleading
    *   Developers' skill *with code built that way*
*   Research software is a [commons](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Commoner-Introduction-Commons/dp/0865717680/):
    *   a shared resource
    *   a community that manages it
    *   a set of social rules governing its use
</section>-->

<!-- @ what makes research projects special -->
<section data-markdown>
**Key Features of Research Software Projects**

*   Developers have extensive domain knowledge, but are largely self-taught programmers
*   Don't know all the right answers, but do know some
*   Requirements may be either:
    *   Discovered as we go along (exploring)
    *   Relatively stable (engineering)
*   Problem is *subtle* as well as *complicated*
*   Getting funding, credit can be difficult

<!-- @ Noble's Rules -->
<section data-markdown>
**[Noble's Rules](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424)**

How to organize small research projects:

*   Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project
*   Put text documents associated with the project in `doc`
*   Put raw data and metadata in `data`
*   Put files generated during cleanup and analysis in `results`
*   Put project source code in `src`
*   Put external scripts, or compiled programs in `bin`
*   Name all files to reflect their content or function
</section>

<!-- @ Taschuk's Rules -->
<section data-markdown>
**[Taschuk's Rules](http://oicr-gsi.github.io/robust-paper/)**

How to make research software more robust:

*   Have a README that explains in a few lines what the software does and what its dependencies are
*   Print usage information when launching from the command line that explains the software's features
*   Give the software a meaningful version number
*   Make older versions available
*   Reuse software (within reason)
</section>
<section data-markdown>
**[Taschuk's Rules](http://oicr-gsi.github.io/robust-paper/)** (cont.)

*   Do not require root or other special privileges
*   Eliminate hard-coded paths
*   Allow configuration of all useful parameters from the command line
*   Include a small test set that can be run to ensure the software is actually working
*   Produce identical results when given identical inputs

From "works on my laptop" to "runs on your cluster".
</section>

<!-- Automated testing -->
<section data-markdown>
**Automated testing**

*   Already have correctness/sanity tests in place (or should!)
*   Invest time to automate these tests
*   Common kinds of tests
    *   Smoke tests (sanity checks)                       <!-- literally, make sure the code doesn't blow up when invoked -->
    *   Unit tests (developer-facing)                     <!-- testing at scale of individual functions/methods -->
    *   Functional tests (user-facing)                    <!-- testing at scale of entire reusable components (scripts, classes, libraries) -->
    *   Regression tests (bug-facing)                     <!-- written when a bug is fixed -->
*   Execute frequently to ensure reliability of software  <!-- setting up for discussion of continuous integration -->
</section>

<!-- @ Version control -->
<section data-markdown>
**Version control**

![Filenames](img/phd052810s.gif)
</section>

<section data-markdown>
**Version control**

*   Provenance (reproducibility)
*   Transparency (credibility, trust)
*   Collaboration (work in parallel, peer review)
*   Hosting (distribution, bug/issue tracking)
*   Facilitates worry-free tinkering
*   Professional obligation! <!-- I would argue that it's a... -->

See [Ram, 2013](https://dx.doi.org/10.1186%2F1751-0473-8-7) and
[Blischak *et al.*, 2016](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1004668)
for an overview.
</section>

<!-- @ Social considerations -->

<section data-markdown>
**Social considerations**

*   [Steinmacher](http://www.igor.pro.br/publica/papers/GSD_CSCW2014.pdf)'s analysis of barriers to contribution
    *   How easy is it to get set up?
    *   How friendly was reception of first contribution?
*   So add the following to Noble's Rules:
    *   `LICENSE`: terms of re-use
        *   **Use a standard license** (preferably MIT)
    *   `CITATION`: how to cite the software
        *   Get a DOI for the software (see [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) and the like)
    *   `CONTRIBUTING`: how to make contributions
    *   `CONDUCT`: project's social rules
</section>
<section data-markdown>
**Social considerations (cont.)**

* Simultaneously selfless and selfish
    * makes science easier to evaluate
    * makes life easier on your colleagues
    * makes it more likely that others will use (and **contribute to!**) your software
    * ensures relevancy of your work when funding runs out or maintainer moves on
    * more likely to impact traditional academic metrics (i.e. citations)
</section>

<section data-markdown>
**A Note on Code Review**

*   Academics review each other's papers; what about code?
*   Re: code review, [Petre](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5648) found:
    *   Requires domain knowledge to be useful
    *   No point doing it at submission time
*   But domain experts are scarce
*   No incentives to review someone else's thesis project code
*   At present, only sustainable within team projects
</section>

<!-- @ overview of agile vs. sturdy -->
<section data-markdown>
**From What to How**

*   These are the things what we want: how do we get there?
*   "Traditional" software development is a planning-intensive engineering discipline
*   Didn't really have a name until "agile" came along in the 1990s
*   Now refer to the engineering approach as "sturdy"
*   Differences between the two are much smaller in practice than in theory
</section>
<section data-markdown>
**Agile vs. Sturdy**

*   Agile: rapid iteration
    *   informal / underdeveloped / changing requirements
    *   frequent (daily) short progress updates
    *   works well for small teams
*   Sturdy: "measure twice, cut once"
    *   formal / mature requirements
    *   more upfront planning and estimation; scheduling enforced by manager(s)
    *   can scale to very large projects
*   We're going to focus on common themes
</section>

<section data-markdown>
**Continuous Integration**

*   Tests are already automated, right...RIGHT?!
*   Re-run regression tests automatically *before* merging changes
*   Ensures baseline is always in runnable state
*   Free CI services for open-source projects
</section>

<section data-markdown>
**Pair Programming**

*   Real-time code review
*   Knowledge transfer ("we all make coffee")
*   Discourages Facebook and Twitter
    *   At least initially
*   Driver and navigator switch roles every hour
    *   With a short break to stay fresh
*   [Empirical studies](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Software-Really-Works-Believe/dp/0596808321/)
    confirm effectiveness
</section>

<section data-markdown>
**Ticketing Systems**

*   Bug/Issue trackers a common fixture on code hosting services
*   Use them to track:
    *   What's broken
    *   What needs to be added
    *   Who's working on what
*   Great place to foster open discussion
</section>

<section data-markdown>
**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**

*   Approach
    *   Write the test
    *   *Then* write the code
    *   Then clean up and commit
    *   "Red-green-refactor"
*   Writing tests first helps with design
    *   And ensures tests actually get written
*   [Empirical studies](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Software-Really-Works-Believe/dp/0596808321/)
    don't confirm effectiveness...
    *   ...but people who use it swear by it
</section>

<section data-markdown>
**[Stupidity-Driven Development](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-research-coding.html)**

*   Write **lots** of tests for scientific core of the code
*   Write few tests for other project components
    *   command-line interface
    *   file I/O
    *   other "boring" and "unimportant" code
*   When bugs are encountered:
    *   fix the observed bug
    *   write new regression tests specific to that bug
    *   get on with more important things
</section>

<section data-markdown>
**[Stupidity-Driven Development](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-research-coding.html)**

*   Avoids wasting time writing tests for bugs that:
    * never appear, or appear rarely
    * don't affect correctness of results
*   Correctness >> Performance >> Convenience
</section>

<section data-markdown>
**Exercise**

*   Polygon overlay is one of the basic operations in geographic information systems.
*   Simplified version is rectangle overlay.
    *   Each rectangle is represented as [x0, y0, x1, y1].

![Rectangle Overlay](img/overlay.png)

*   Given two valid rectangles as input,
    `overlay` return the rectangle that is their overlap.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
**Exercise**

*   What are the three most interesting tests to write for this function?
*   Describe in terms of input 1, input 2, expected output, and why it's important.
    *   Assume input rectangles are well-formed (i.e., nobody's trying to pass in a character string).
*   Come with answers on your own, then compare with your neighbor and select the best three.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
**Finally, A Note on Overtime**

*   [Robinson](http://www.igda.org/?page=crunchsixlessons):
    working overtime when you're late only makes you later
*   Every all nighter reduces cognitive function 25%
    *   So after two all nighters,
        you would not legally be considered competent to care for yourself
*   Optimal work cycle is:
    *   45-50 minutes of work + 10 minutes of activity
    *   8 hours/day
    *   5 days/week
