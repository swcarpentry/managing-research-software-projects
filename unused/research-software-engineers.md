title: "Research Software Engineers"
teaching: 10
exercises: 10
questions:
- "What is a research software engineer?"
objectives:
- "Explain what research software engineers do and don't do."
keypoints:
- "Research software engineers usually have advanced degrees in a research area, but are no longer principally doing research."
- "Research software engineers design, write, test, and maintain software."
- "Research software engineers need to understand languages, version control, build and test tools, performance tools, packaging, and lifecycle management."

*   [What is a research software engineer][what-is-rse] (RSE)?
    *   Combine expertise in programming with an in-depth understanding of research
    *   Typically have:
        *   An advanced degree in a research discipline
        *   Lots of experience developing software (often acquired while working on their thesis)...
        *   ...but little or no formal training in software engineering
    *   "The astronomers who build telescopes so that others can study stars"
*   What *isn't* an RSE?
    *   Sys admin (although many RSEs wind up doing a lot of systems administration)
    *   Lab tech (although sometimes classified as such)
    *   Principal investigator (although RSEs occasionally become PIs on infrastructure projects)
*   What do RSEs do?
    *   *Design, write, test, and maintain software*
    *   Manage data (or build tools to fetch, filter, organize, and process data)
    *   Deploy and run software (overlaps with sys admins)
*   What do RSEs need to know?
    *   Programming language(s) - in more depth than most of their research colleagues
    *   Version control - ditto
    *   Build and test tools - often the only one on their team doing any of this
    *   Performance analysis and tuning - ditto
    *   Packaging and deployment - ditto (and then some)
    *   Software lifecycle management - often de facto process owners
        *   What needs to be done?
        *   Why?
        *   Who's doing it?
        *   When is it due?
        *   What state is it in (i.e., are we done yet)?
        *   Where is everything?
        *   How do we do things?

> ## Are You an RSE?
>
> Score yourself using the questions below.
>
> 1.  Are you employed to develop software for research?
> 1.  Are you spending more time developing software than conducting research?
> 1.  Are you employed as a postdoctoral researcher,
>     even though you predominantly work on software development?
> 1.  Are you the person who does computers in your research group?
> 1.  Are you sometimes not named on research papers
>     despite playing a fundamental part in developing the software used to create them?
> 1.  Do you lack the metrics needed to progress your academic career,
>     like papers and conference presentations,
>     despite having made a significant contribution through software?
